        <p>
            International Mother Language Day is observed on 21 February to commemorate the historic language movement of 1952 in Bangladesh.<br><br>
            On this day, students gave their lives to defend their mother tongue, Bangla, after Urdu was declared the only national language of Pakistan.<br><br>
            The movement resulted in Bangla being recognized as a national language in 1956 and later becoming the official language of independent Bangladesh in 1971.<br><br>
            In 1999, UNESCO declared 21 February as International Mother Language Day to promote linguistic diversity, multilingualism, and the protection of mother languages worldwide.

    <p>
        Multilingual education plays a vital role in preserving cultural heritage and promoting inclusive learning.
        It encourages people to learn in their mother tongue while also gaining knowledge of other languages,
        creating a balanced and enriched educational experience.<br><br>

        Learning through one's mother language helps improve understanding, confidence, and academic success,
        especially for young learners. It allows students to connect deeply with their culture, traditions,
        and identity while building a strong foundation for lifelong learning.<br><br>

        Around the world, colorful and interactive digital maps are being used to illustrate linguistic diversity.
        These maps showcase thousands of languages, helping people explore different cultures and understand the
        importance of preserving endangered languages.<br><br>

        By combining modern technology with traditional knowledge, multilingual education ensures that cultural
        heritage is protected and passed on to future generations.
