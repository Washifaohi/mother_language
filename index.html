        <p>
            International Mother Language Day is observed on 21 February to honor the historic language movement of
            1952 in Bangladesh.<br><br>
            On this day, students sacrificed their lives to protect their mother tongue, Bangla, after Urdu was
            declared the sole national language of Pakistan.<br><br>
            The movement led to the recognition of Bangla as a national language in 1956 and later as the official
            language of independent Bangladesh in 1971.<br><br>
            In 1999, UNESCO proclaimed 21 February as International Mother Language Day to promote linguistic
            diversity, multilingualism, and the protection of all mother languages around the world.

        <p>
            Every year, countless people gather at the Shaheed Minar, removing their shoes and standing barefoot on
            the sacred ground as a symbol of reverence. With hearts full of gratitude and heads bowed in solemn
            respect, they place colorful flowers at the monument’s base, honoring the brave language martyrs who
            sacrificed their lives to protect and celebrate the mother tongue. The air is filled with quiet
            reflection, a poignant reminder of the courage and unity that preserved the identity and dignity of a
            people through their language.

        <p>
            In 2026, International Mother Language Day places a special focus on the role of youth and digital
            innovation in preserving languages. Young creators, students, and activists are using technology to
            protect and promote their mother tongues in creative and impactful ways.<br><br>

            Digital platforms such as mobile apps, online dictionaries, social media, and virtual archives are
            helping document endangered languages and make them accessible to future generations. Through videos,
            blogs, and educational content, young people are raising awareness about linguistic diversity across
            the globe.<br><br>

            Language learning apps, podcasts, and digital storytelling are also making it easier for people to
            learn and use their native languages alongside global languages. These efforts ensure that no language
            is forgotten and that every culture continues to thrive in the digital age.<br><br>

            By combining tradition with technology, youth are becoming powerful advocates for preserving language
            heritage and building a more inclusive, multilingual world.
