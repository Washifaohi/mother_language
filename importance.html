        <p>21 February is observed as International Mother Language Day, a day dedicated to promoting the preservation
            and protection of all languages. The date commemorates the martyrs of the 1952 Bengali Language Movement,
            who lost their lives defending their mother tongue. The movement arose in protest against the government's
            decision to declare Urdu as the only official language, disregarding the Bengali-speaking majority of East
            Pakistan (present-day Bangladesh). Today, nearly 40% of the world's population lacks access to education in
            a language they speak or understand. International Mother Language Day serves as an important reminder to
            celebrate linguistic diversity and promote inclusive, multilingual education worldwide.</p>

        <p>In Bangladesh, 21 February 1952 is the anniversary of the day when the Bengalis of the then-Pakistani
            province of East Bengal (now Bangladesh) fought for recognition of their Bengali language as an official
            state language instead of a provincial language. The day is also observed by Indian Bengalis in the states
            of West Bengal, Assam, Jharkhand, and Tripura, as well as in the union territory of the Andaman and Nicobar
            Islands.</p>

        <p>Language is the primary tool through which humans communicate, express their thoughts, and share
            experiences. It is not just a means of exchanging information, but also a cornerstone of personal and
            cultural identity. Through language, individuals connect with family, friends, and communities, fostering
            social bonds and creating a sense of belonging. Recognizing this, UNESCO emphasizes that the preservation of
            cultural and linguistic diversity is vital for building inclusive and sustainable societies worldwide. Yet,
            in today's rapidly globalizing world, countless languages are vanishing at an alarming rate. Every year,
            communities lose unique languages that carry generations of history, traditions, and wisdom.</p>

        <p>The disappearance of a language is more than just the loss of words—it represents the erosion of cultural
            heritage, local knowledge, and a unique worldview. Without the ability to communicate in their native
            languages, many communities face difficulties in education, social participation, and even in understanding
            developments beyond their local environment. Protecting linguistic diversity, therefore, is not merely about
            saving words; it is about safeguarding the identity, knowledge, and resilience of entire cultures for future
            generations.</p>

            <li>Honor the sacrifices of the language martyrs of 1952 who gave their lives for linguistic rights.</li>
            <li>Promote linguistic diversity and support inclusive, multilingual education.</li>
            <li>Recognize that every language carries unique culture, history, and wisdom.</li>
            <li>Encourage younger generations to learn, speak, and preserve their native languages.</li>
            <li>Stand against the extinction of languages and advocate for global cultural preservation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Remembering these values helps us build a world that respects diversity, fosters understanding, and honors
            the legacy of those who fought for their language and identity.</p>
